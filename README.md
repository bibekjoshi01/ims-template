# Contributing to Project 🔐

Remember, Good PR makes you a Good contributor !

We work hard to maintain the structure, and [use conventional Pull](https://github.com/bibekjoshi01/ims-template/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-title-format-) request titles and commits. Without a proper template for the PR, not following the guidelines and spam might get the pull request closed, or banned.
